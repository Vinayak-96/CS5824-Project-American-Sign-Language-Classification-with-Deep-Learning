# CS5824-Project-American-Sign-Language-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

As part of our final project for the course CS5824 Advanced Machine Learning, we had utilized the American Sign Language image dataset available at Kaggle and classified the images based on the hand gestures to English alphabets. We had primarily focused on a relatively new and popular deep learning model called vision transformers and compared the performance against other models such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).

To run the code, download the dataset from here :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet and change the "train_dir" accordingly in ViT_ASL_Classification_Final.ipynb. This file is where our main code resides

The CNN_ASL_Classification_Final.ipynb emulates the same code in the other Vision Transformer file, but for a convolutional neural network model.
